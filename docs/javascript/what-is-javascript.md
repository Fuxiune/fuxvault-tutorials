# What is Javascript ?

Javascript seems to be everywhere in the world wide web and a clear definition is not that easy to find in my honest opinion. Javascript (JS)
is one of the core programming languages when you build websites. 98% of websites uses Javascript on the client side for webpage behaviors. Even if you don't
write all the website's logic in Javascript, there are definetly parts that profit from Javascript code. In the last decades Javascript was often used to change the behavior of websites. Assume that you have a website where you can order a pizza and when you select your favorite pizza, the pizza gets animated and "flies" to your cart. 
Everything that is not static and gets changed, animated or colored, was often triggered by Javascript. There are alternatives in the present to animate and color things, but even today you need sometimes Javascript to get things done.

You can also write whole programs and servers with Javascript. A lot of frameworks in 2023 encourage you to use Javascript and write almost everything with it.

This website is also using Javascript and wouldn't work that way without it.

You can read tons of definitions what Javascript is but you will just get it when you work with it. FuxVault has a lot of topics and examples to present you what Javascript
is and how you can use it to reach your goals. ðŸ’ª
